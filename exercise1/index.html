<h3><font color="#ff9a00">1.</font></h3><em>Grab two slices of your favorite type of bread.</em> Any bread will do, but sourdough is considered best for paninis as it keeps its structure with wet fillings and toasts well.</div>

<div id="22"><h3><font color="#ff9a00">2.</font></h3><em>Lay some lettuce and leftover cranberry sauce on a slice. </em>The lettuce will prevent the sauce and fillings from making the bread too soggy, and the cranberry sauce will add a sweet touch.</div>

<div id="23"><h3><font color="#ff9a00">3.</font></h3><em>Layer slices of your leftover turkey on top of the cranberry sauce. </em>Generally you should use just enough to make a single layer, to stop the sandwich from getting too big, but if you don't mind using a knife and fork, go ahead and add as much as your heart desires.
You can optionally spread mashed potatoes or stuffing on the turkey for a heartier panini. You can certainly add both, but it will end up being a heavy meal to eat in one sitting.</div>

<div id="24"><h3><font color="#ff9a00">4.</font></h3><em>Mash up some candied yams to add a sweet touch to the panini.</em> This is not required to make the panini, but some find that the candied yams make the sandwich taste sweeter. If you used a lot of cranberry sauce, candied yams can counteract its tartness but can also make the sandwich overpoweringly sweet, so be careful of how much you add.</div>

<div id="25"><h3><font color="#ff9a00">5.</font></h3><em>
Pour gravy on the top of your fillings and put the bread slices together.</em> Don't go overboard on gravy, as you still have to cook the panini and a runny sandwich is hard to grill correctly. Put the sandwich together and spread a light layer of butter on the outside of the bread.
A good rule of thumb is to use enough gravy to be able to spread a thin layer on the top slice, so that the bread absorbs some of the liquid and becomes more flavorful while also controlling the gravy's messiness.</div>

<div id="26"><h3><font color="#ff9a00">6.</font></h3><em>
Cook on medium-low heat in a grill pan or skillet.</em> Cook it until the bread looks crusty, not burnt, and make sure the fillings are hot. You can use a panini maker if you have one, but it is not required. Once it's done, grab a plate, a knife and fork if the sandwich is gigantic, and enjoy!
